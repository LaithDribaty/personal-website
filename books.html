            <p>
              When learning technologies or programs we should read the latest released books and courses but for now (2022-4-25) i would recommend this book as a start for blender, the book contains chapters that explain all panels in blender briefly and shows you what can you do with blender.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also the book gives you information of doing 3d stuff in general and specificly in blender like modeling a human and rigging him and making animation.. eventualy make you confortable with other programs that you might use later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simple language and great organizing.. It could be the entry point for the whole world of 3d.

              from basics into everything that you can do in three.js, ofcourse not everything letterly because we may mix some concepts always making new things and wonderful scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
              the book has github repo that holds examples of each chapter which helps alot later when copy pasting some code fragments.

            </p>
            <p>
              this book explain so many things that we use everyday in our applications, but actually it explain the real algorithms which we rarly to work with as long as there are apps that provide friendly simple api to use it.
            </p>
            <p>
              the book covers some hashing algorithms, cache systems, disjoint sets, string processing (trie, radix trie..), multidimensional indexing, Nearest Neighboor Search, clustering, graph theory and genetic algorithms

              Design pattern is one of the most important concepts to learn in software engineering..
              It is the matter of keeping everything organized, maintainable, readable, fast and open to be expanded in the future.

            <p>
              So this book shows us with some meaningful drawing (cute drawing actually) the work flow and cons pros usage and details of every famouse design pattern that you will use in some points of your work.
